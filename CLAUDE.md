# array

## Allocation size is bounded on purpose

`alloc` takes at most 1048576 elements (`{n:pos | n <= 1048576}`). This is a
design constraint, not an oversight: capping arbitrary allocations limits
heap fragmentation. Do not raise it, and do not work around it with a
bigger raw allocation somewhere else.

Code that needs more memory than one bounded allocation (a large file, a
large output) uses a pool: one region reserved up front, handed out in
pieces whose sizes the types account for, and released as a whole.

## The arena is the pool

`arena_create<a>(max)` reserves one zeroed region of `max` elements (up to
268435456); `arena_alloc` hands out pieces of it, `arena_return` takes them
back, and `arena_destroy` releases the region. It is sound by type, with
no runtime checks:

* The arena's type tracks the elements handed out (`used`), so a piece
  that does not fit (`used + n > max`) does not type-check.
* A piece is `arrx(a, l, n, la)`, owned by its arena's address `la`.
  `free` takes only `arr(a, l, n)` (= `arrx(a, l, n, null)`, what
  `alloc` returns), so a piece cannot be freed; `arena_return` takes only
  the pieces of that arena. Everything that reads or writes an array
  (get, set, freeze, write_*) works for any owner.
* The arena counts outstanding pieces (`k`); `arena_destroy` needs
  `k = 0`.
* Pieces are never reused, so they are zero bytes; as with `alloc`,
  `arena_create` has instances only for element types where zero bytes
  are a valid value.
* When the region cannot be had, `arena_create` returns `arena_none`,
  never a null arena.

The first arena (removed in #21 and restored here) had none of these:
`arena_alloc` never compared its offset to the size, its arrays could be
freed, and it handed out zero bytes as any type. Fix such problems; do
not delete the facility.

`tests/static` rejects each misuse (overfill, freeing a piece, returning
it to another arena, destroying with a piece out, a pointer element
type); `tests/dynamic/arena` exercises pieces past the 1 MiB `alloc`
bound.
